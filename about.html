        I'm a rising junior at columbia university,
        and I'm majoring in cs and minoring in econ (seas '22). my hometown is chattanooga, tennessee.
        I have strong interests in machine learning and computational biology research,
        but I also find full-stack development pretty fun.
        I'm an avid soccer fan, like to go on runs, and am in a tight-knit family of four.
