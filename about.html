		<p id="biography">I'm an undergrad in my sophomore year at columbia university, and I'm majoring in cs and minoring in econ (seas '22). my hometown is chattanooga, tennessee. I have strong interests in machine learning and computational biology research, but I also find full-stack development pretty fun. I'm an avid soccer fan, like to go on runs, and am in a tight-knit family of four.
